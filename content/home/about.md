# About

Hello, I'm Tom Williams, a Royal Society University Research Fellow at the University of Bristol. I run a [research group]({{< relref "#people" >}}) in computational evolutionary biology. Broadly, my research aims to understand how evolution works, and to infer and interpret the early history of life on Earth. To do that, we use computers to analyse the genome sequences of interesting organisms from across the tree of life---but especially from microbes, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic.

I'm currently looking to expand the lab, so please get in touch if you would like to apply for funding together.
